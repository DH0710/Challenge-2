            <p> Hello, My Name is Damien Hebert, and I am from Beaumont, Tx </br>
                I joined this bootcamp program with the hopes of changing my career path from what my current job is, currently an environmental techcian for FLNG gas plant in Freeport, Texas. My job is pretty simple once you get to the basis of it. 
                I searched specific units within the plant for gas leaks and once i find them, I then document the location and type of valve that is leaking, then a 3rd party tech is sent out to fix the component and stop the leak. 
                From the year and half that Ive spent working in the oil and gas industry. I gained a fair amount of experience there and in my honest opinion i dont feel challenged here. I dont feel like im part of a team within my sector. To add this job can be very dangerous at times and 
                from the amount of physical strain it takes i dont see myself doing this forever. Ived always had an interest in technology and i thought taking a bootcamp would be a sure fire way for me to make that change in lifestyle.
